## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In this project, we aim to design and train a chatbot based on Google powered Dialogflow to automatically handle usersâ€™ general enquiries about Institute of System Sciences (ISS) at National University of Singapore (NUS).The main objectives are to increase the efficiency of information retrieval and to provide more human-like conversational experiences.


Our team: ai.Orz: comprising of 6 members: Dai Yirui, Dong Meirong, Gu Lijian, Guo Feng, Wong Yoke Keong, Zhang Le are from different areas including financial services, healthcare, cloud, software engineering. We hope to deliver a widely used platform which can bring core-value to hospitals, helping hospitals to do digital transformation, improve efficiencies, lower operational costs and integrate solution with enterprises' existing systems.
